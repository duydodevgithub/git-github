How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff show us the difference between those two files. Line with minus/plus sign represent for which line has been removed/added to the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So we can keep track of what we've already changed and who has changed it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing when to create a commit:
        pros: - We can control what and when to save the files
        cons: - may loose data when computer is unexpected shut down
    Automatically saved:
        pros: do not loose data when computer have problems
        cons: it saved everything to the database
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Verson control system like Git is designed for software development. 
    When working with software, we need to work on multiples files.

    For Google Docs, we usually work on 1 files at a times.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will help us to roll back to previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for my projects.
